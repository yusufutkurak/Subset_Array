# Subset_Array

Write a program that fills two integer arrays of sizes M and N (N < M < 20) with user input and
sends both the arrays and their sizes to a function. This function should check if the second array
is a subset of the first array and return 1 if it is (0 otherwise). Depending on the value returned
from the function, display a proper message on screen.
